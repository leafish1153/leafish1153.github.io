Research Organizer
Conduct research on your TRC Call to Action, and record the research below. Make sure you include all links to your sources! You should have a minimum of three (3) different sources.

WHAT?

What is your topic? Explain it.
The topic I chose is Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, this refers to the climbing violence rates, disappearances and murders of Indigenous females. The issue represents a serious human issue, however, it has only recently gained significant attention from the national media. It can be broken down into systemic violence and discrimination neglect.

WHO?

Who is involved in this issue? 


Explain the different people or groups of people.
To start off, Indigenous women and girls are clearly the victims of this crisis. However, other groups that are involved could include Indigenous communities, women advocacy groups, and international organizations actively working to solve these issues. The victims are experiencing violence that is made up of racism, sexism, and discrimination, while the other groups are trying their best to help give their own solution to the issue.

WHERE?

Where is this happening or where is it relevant?
The issue of MMIWG is most observable in Canada, however, it is also relevant in other countries with Indigenous populations such as the United States and Australia. These nations face similar challenges to the protection and justice given to Indigenous women, or to say, Indigenous communities in general.

WHEN?

When did it happen, or is it currently happening?

Explain the significance of the time period.
The crisis has been an ongoing challenge for decades with significant calls to action, however, it has only recently gained main attention from the media and content creators. This increased awareness in the modern day brings much more sense of urgency and many people are now actively working to address the challenges.

WHY?

Why did this topic become a TRC Call to Action? 

Why is it significant in Canada today? 
This topic is occurring as the colonization of European settlers heavily disrupted the traditions of Indigenous societies which caused systemic racism and discrimination. 

The creator is choosing to make a video related to this as there is inadequate law enforcement and lots of policy gaps that relate to gender-based violence, human rights violations, etc.
