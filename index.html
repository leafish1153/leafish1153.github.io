      <p>Call to Action #76 urges the Canadian government and churches to work with Indigenous communities to document, protect, and commemorate burial sites connected to former residential schools. Thousands of Indigenous children died while under state care, often without records, marked graves, or acknowledgment.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <p>This call recognizes that reconciliation cannot occur without truth. Memorialization restores dignity to children whose identities were erased through forced assimilation, cultural genocide, and neglect.</p>
      <p>By locating and honoring burial sites, Canada confronts the legacy of residential schools rather than hiding it.</p>

  <h2>Missing & Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls</h2>
  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card">
      <img src="image2.jpg" alt="Red dress installation">
      <p>MMIWG2S+ refers to the disproportionately high rates of violence experienced by Indigenous women, girls, and Two-Spirit people. Indigenous women in Canada are nearly four times more likely than non-Indigenous women to be victims of violence.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <p>This crisis is rooted in colonialism, systemic racism, sexism, and institutional failure. The same systems that allowed residential schools to exist continue to fail Indigenous communities today.</p>
      <p>The red dress has become a symbol of absence, representing lives lost and justice denied.</p>

  <h2>Where and When Is This Happening?</h2>
  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card">
      <img src="image5.jpg" alt="Indigenous territories map">
      <p>MMIWG is most visible in Canada but also affects Indigenous communities in the United States and Australia. These regions share colonial histories that disrupted Indigenous systems of protection and justice.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <img src="image4.jpg" alt="MMIWG vigil">
      <p>Although Indigenous communities have spoken out for decades, widespread attention increased in the 2010s through activism, art, and digital advocacy. The National Inquiry into MMIWG was launched in 2016, recognizing the crisis as a human rights violation.</p>
