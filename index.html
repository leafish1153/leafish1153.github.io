  <p>Honouring the Missing Children of Residential Schools & Raising Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls</p>

<section>
  <h2>What Is the Call to Action?</h2>
  <div class="split">
    <div>
      <p>The Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Call to Action #76 urges the Canadian government, churches, and communities to work with Indigenous peoples to document, protect, and commemorate burial sites associated with former residential schools. Thousands of Indigenous children died while in the care of these institutions, many without records, graves, or acknowledgment.</p>
      <p>This call to action is about restoring dignity to children who were systematically stripped of their identities, cultures, and families. It recognizes that reconciliation cannot exist without truth, remembrance, and accountability.</p>

  <h2>What Is MMIWG?</h2>
  <div class="split">
    <img src="image3.jpg" alt="Indigenous women community">
    <div>
      <p>Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG2S+) refers to the disproportionately high rates of violence, disappearances, and deaths experienced by Indigenous women, girls, and Two-Spirit people. Indigenous women in Canada are nearly four times more likely than non-Indigenous women to be victims of violence.</p>
      <p>This crisis is not random. It is the result of long-standing colonial policies, systemic racism, gender-based discrimination, and institutional neglect that continue to devalue Indigenous lives.</p>
    </div>

<section>
  <h2>Where Is This Happening?</h2>
  <div class="split">
    <div>
      <p>MMIWG is most visible in Canada but also affects Indigenous communities in countries such as the United States and Australia. These regions share colonial histories that disrupted Indigenous governance, justice systems, and community protections.</p>
      <p>In Canada, violence against Indigenous women occurs both in urban centers and remote communities, often compounded by inadequate policing, jurisdictional gaps, and limited access to resources.</p>

  <h2>When Did Awareness Grow?</h2>
  <div class="split">
    <img src="image4.jpg" alt="MMIWG vigil">
    <div>
      <p>Although Indigenous communities have raised concerns for decades, national attention to MMIWG significantly increased in the 2010s through activism, art installations, and digital advocacy. The National Inquiry into MMIWG was launched in 2016, acknowledging the crisis as a serious human rights violation.</p>
      <p>Today, social media has become a powerful space for education and remembrance, allowing younger generations to engage with issues that were previously ignored.</p>

  <h2>Symbols of Remembrance</h2>
  <div class="split">
    <div>
      <p>The red dress has become a widely recognized symbol representing missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls. Each empty dress symbolizes a life taken, a story silenced, and a family grieving.</p>
      <p>These installations confront the public with absence — forcing society to acknowledge who is missing and why.</p>

  <h2>Your Role: Learn, Share, Act</h2>
  <p>Reconciliation is not passive. It requires learning uncomfortable truths, amplifying Indigenous voices, and supporting justice-driven initiatives. Youth play a crucial role in reshaping narratives and ensuring that these histories are not forgotten.</p>
