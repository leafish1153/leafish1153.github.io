  <h2>Truth and Reconciliation Commission: Call to Action #76</h2>
  <div class="highlight">
    <strong>Residential Schools Missing Children</strong><br />
    Call to Action #76 calls upon the federal government to work with Indigenous communities
    to identify, document, maintain, and commemorate burial sites of children who died while
    attending residential schools.
  </div>
  <p>
    Thousands of Indigenous children were taken from their families and placed into
    residential schools, where many faced neglect, abuse, and poor living conditions.
    Many children never returned home, and their deaths were often undocumented or hidden.
  </p>
  <p>
    This call to action emphasizes truth-telling and remembrance. It seeks to honour the
    children who were lost and provide families and communities with answers, dignity,
    and long-overdue recognition.

  <h2>Research Focus: Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls</h2>

  <div class="card-grid">
    <div class="card">
      <h4>What?</h4>
      <p>
        Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls refers to the disproportionately high
        rates of violence, disappearances, and murders experienced by Indigenous women.
        This violence is rooted in systemic racism, sexism, and colonial policies.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h4>Who?</h4>
      <p>
        Indigenous women and girls are the primary victims. Indigenous communities,
        advocacy groups, and international organizations work to raise awareness and
        push for justice and systemic change.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h4>Where?</h4>
      <p>
        The crisis is most visible in Canada but is also relevant in countries such as the
        United States and Australia, where Indigenous communities face similar patterns
        of violence and discrimination.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h4>When?</h4>
      <p>
        This has been an ongoing crisis for decades. While families and communities have
        spoken out for years, national and media attention has increased only in recent times.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h4>Why?</h4>
      <p>
        European colonization disrupted Indigenous societies, imposed harmful policies,
        and created long-lasting systems of discrimination. These structures continue to
        contribute to violence and lack of accountability today.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="highlight">
    Indigenous women are nearly four times more likely than non-Indigenous women to
    experience violence. The red dress has become a powerful symbol to honour those who
    are missing or murdered, representing both loss and remembrance.
  </div>
