  <h2>TRC Call to Action #76 — What & Why</h2>
  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card">
      <img src="image6.jpg" alt="Residential school memorial">
      <p><strong>What it asks:</strong> Call to Action #76 asks governments, religious institutions, and communities to partner with Indigenous peoples to locate, document, and memorialize burial sites of children who died while attending Canadian residential schools.</p>
      <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> For decades, families were denied information about the fate of their children. Properly identifying burial sites creates space for mourning, truth-telling, and community-led commemoration. It is a cornerstone step toward accountability and healing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Historical Context</h3>
      <p>From the late 1800s through the late 20th century, thousands of Indigenous children were removed from their homes and placed in residential schools. Designed to assimilate Indigenous children into Euro‑Canadian culture, these institutions frequently subjected children to neglect, abuse, malnutrition, and disease.</p>
      <p>Many children died and were buried without proper records. The absence of acknowledgment contributed to intergenerational trauma and a long-standing lack of closure for families and communities.</p>

  <h2>Missing & Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG2S+)</h2>
  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card">
      <img src="image3.jpg" alt="Indigenous women community">
      <p><strong>Definition:</strong> MMIWG2S+ refers to the epidemic of violence, disappearances, and murders disproportionately affecting Indigenous women, girls, and Two-Spirit people. This includes loved ones who have been murdered, remain missing, or whose disappeared status has not been adequately investigated.</p>
      <p><strong>Root Causes:</strong> The violence is not isolated — it is tied to colonial dispossession, systemic racism within institutions (health, justice, policing), economic marginalization, inadequate social services, and gendered violence perpetuated over generations.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Statistics & Scope</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Indigenous women face violent victimization at rates significantly higher than non-Indigenous women.</li>
        <li>Cases are underreported and underinvestigated; many families struggle to get information or action from authorities.</li>
        <li>The National Inquiry into MMIWG (2016–2019) produced a comprehensive report and Calls for Justice addressing systemic failures.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These numbers reflect structural problems rather than random variation — meaning policy and systemic change are needed to protect lives and ensure justice.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Personal & Community Impact</h3>
      <p>Each case represents a family, a network of relationships, and cultural loss. Communities experience collective grief, fear, and anger; survivors and relatives often report frustration with how investigations are handled and the lack of culturally appropriate supports.</p>
      <p>Memorials, art projects, and community-led databases exist to reclaim stories, remember victims, and demand systemic reform.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>National Inquiry & Calls for Justice</h3>
      <p>The National Inquiry into MMIWG concluded with a Final Report that characterized the violence as rooted in colonialism and systemic discrimination, and it issued hundreds of Calls for Justice aimed at governments, institutions, and all Canadians to take specific actions to prevent violence and ensure healing.</p>
      <p>Examples of Calls for Justice include improving police responses, increasing Indigenous-led services, and ensuring culturally safe investigations and supports for families.</p>

  <h2>Where & When — Geographic and Temporal Context</h2>
  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card">
      <img src="image5.jpg" alt="Indigenous territories map">
      <p>While the crisis is most widely documented in Canada, similar patterns of violence occur in other settler-colonial states such as the United States and Australia. Colonial policies disrupted Indigenous governance and social structures across these regions, contributing to shared vulnerabilities.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <img src="image4.jpg" alt="MMIWG vigil">
      <p>Although Indigenous communities have resisted and documented these harms for decades, wide public attention increased in the 2010s through grassroots activism, media coverage, artistic works, and digital advocacy. The National Inquiry (2016–2019) represented a major national reckoning, but many advocates emphasize that implementation of recommendations remains uneven.</p>

  <h2>Symbols, Memorials, and Cultural Responses</h2>
  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card">
      <img src="image2.jpg" alt="Red dress installation">
      <p><strong>Red Dress Project:</strong> Artist Jaime Black’s REDress Project uses empty red dresses to symbolize the lives of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls. The stark red display communicates absence, loss, and a visual demand for attention.</p>
      <p>Other forms of remembrance include vigils, memorials, oral history projects, and dedicated days of recognition (such as May 5 — Red Dress Day).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Art as Advocacy</h3>
      <p>Artists, filmmakers, and writers have used creative expression to center Indigenous experiences, educate broader audiences, and pressure institutions to act. Creative forms of remembrance make invisible stories visible and foster empathy across communities.</p>
